### Notes

This is forked from [here](https://github.com/oransel/fastify-simple-ws) which was forked from [here](https://github.com/gj/fastify-ws). The codebase isn't complex and I rely on it for many projects so I figured I'd at least have a scoped version that has updated dependencies on a regular basis.

Also, no support for `uws`.
